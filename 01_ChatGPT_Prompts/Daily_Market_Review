## 📋 Prompt to Copy:

You're acting as my daily chart analyst. I will send you 3 screenshots (4H, 1H, 15M) and my 30-minute range with levels labeled.

Your job:
1. Confirm current bias — bullish, bearish, or neutral  
2. Create a dual-path scenario:  
   - Bullish path (what has to happen?)  
   - Bearish path (what would flip bias?)  
3. Flag any trap zones or overlap risk  
4. Suggest whether today is clean or high-risk

End with a clear directional statement like:  
> “Bias: Bullish continuation above $____ — watch for trap at $____”
